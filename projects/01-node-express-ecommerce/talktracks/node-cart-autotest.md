Talk track outline:
- Context: Cart logic has grown; coverage is low; regressions occur.
- Goal: Use Amp to scaffold Jest tests and raise coverage by 20%.
- Steps:
  1. Locate cart service implementation.
  2. Prompt Amp to generate tests.
  3. Run tests with coverage and show delta.
- Evidence: Coverage report, green tests.
